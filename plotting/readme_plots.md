Contained here are plotting scripts and preplotted images.
If you want to run the files, you will need to move them to the top level. They are here purely for reference on how some of the
figures available were produced.

In the case of kmeans_plots.py, this is a dynamic script, that requires a folder called k_means with the directory structure containing k_means/images
and k_means/data to be present. You will need to create these folders yourself also in the top level before running.
